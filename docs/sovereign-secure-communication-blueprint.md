## 1. Executive Summary

This platform is a zero-trust, end-to-end encrypted communication system for high-risk organizations. It is not a normal chat app. The backend is a delivery, policy, identity, audit, and encrypted storage plane. It must not receive plaintext messages, plaintext attachments, private keys, group secrets, or decrypted message metadata except where a specific enterprise policy explicitly accepts the privacy/security tradeoff.
